# About

Prestige is an HTTP client, a developer tool for people working with APIs and other HTTP endpoints.

I've had the idea for a text-based HTTP client like Prestige for several years now, but I've been working on this latest
incarnation of the idea since late 2019. One of the more well-received previous implementations is the
[roast.vim](https://github.com/sharat87/roast.vim) plugin that does a version of this idea as a Vim plugin.

## Get Involved

The project is open source (distributed using the [Apache-2.0
license](https://github.com/sharat87/prestige/blob/master/LICENSE)), with source code available on [the GitHub
project](https://github.com/sharat87/prestige).

Contributions are welcome, for the *most part*. But if it's even slightly non-trivial, or more than a few lines of code
changes, I'd strongly urge you to [open an issue](https://github.com/sharat87/prestige/issues/new) first to discuss it
out before working towards a PR. Among other things, this can help avoid overlaps where we're both working on the same
thing, and we realize it only after you open a PR.

## Sustainability

This app is currently free since it doesn't cost me *much* to maintain it. I spend multiple hours every weekend on
features and bug fixes, but I'm currently focused on working with stuff that directly impact my work during weekdays. So
the effort I spend on Prestige, kind of pays off elsewhere.

But obviously, this is not sustainable. Depending on traction and wider adoption, if there's a need for more features
and functionality, I wouldn't shy away from introducing a paid subscription plan to help sustain it's maintenance.
